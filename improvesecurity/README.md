# Improving security 

#### 1. **Use a Stronger Key Derivation Function**:
   - **Issue**: PBKDF2, while still widely used, is not the most resilient to GPU-based attacks due to its relatively fast performance.
   - **Recommendation**: Consider using a more modern key derivation function like **Argon2** or **scrypt**, which are designed to be memory-hard and resistant to hardware-accelerated brute-force attacks. These functions make it much harder to crack passwords via brute force due to their computational and memory requirements.
   
   **Why?**: Both Argon2 and scrypt are slow to compute and can require large amounts of memory, making it more resistant to parallel attacks from specialized hardware like GPUs or FPGAs.

#### 2. **Use a Sufficient Number of Iterations for PBKDF2**:
   - **Issue**: While you are using 100,000 iterations, which is reasonable for PBKDF2, increasing this number over time is recommended as hardware improves.
   - **Recommendation**: For PBKDF2, aim for at least **310,000 iterations** (as recommended by NIST) to ensure the password derivation process is sufficiently slow.
   
   **Why?**: PBKDF2 is designed to slow down brute-force attacks. By increasing the number of iterations, you make it computationally expensive for attackers to try different passwords.

#### 3. **Ensure a Secure Passphrase**:
   - **Issue**: If a user selects a weak passphrase, even strong encryption and key derivation functions won't prevent an attacker from guessing it.
   - **Recommendation**: Enforce strong passphrase policies (e.g., minimum length, use of upper/lower case letters, numbers, and special characters). Additionally, consider using a **password manager** to generate and store strong random passphrases.
   
   **Why?**: A weak passphrase is vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks, which can render even the best encryption ineffective.

#### 4. **Use a Strong Random Number Generator for Salt and IV**:
   - **Issue**: The security of your key derivation and encryption relies on the randomness of the salt and initialization vector (IV). If a weak random number generator is used, attackers may predict or manipulate these values.
   - **Recommendation**: Use a **cryptographically secure random number generator** (CSPRNG) like `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` for generating both the salt and IV.
   
   **Why?**: A strong, unpredictable salt and IV ensure that the encryption process remains secure even if some parts of the system are compromised.

#### 5. **Ensure Proper IV Length**:
   - **Issue**: The AES-GCM mode requires a 12-byte (96-bit) IV for optimal security and performance. Using an IV length different from 12 bytes may reduce the effectiveness of GCM mode.
   - **Recommendation**: Ensure the IV is exactly 12 bytes (96 bits).
   
   **Why?**: AES-GCM works best with a 96-bit IV. Longer IVs will need to be hashed, potentially weakening security. Shorter IVs will reduce the number of messages that can be safely encrypted with the same key.

#### 6. **Handle Authentication Failures Gracefully**:
   - **Issue**: When decryption fails (e.g., due to tampering or incorrect passwords), make sure the system does not leak information about why it failed.
   - **Recommendation**: Use **generic error messages** (like "Decryption failed") and avoid revealing whether the passphrase was incorrect or if the data was modified.
   
   **Why?**: Leaking information (like whether the passphrase or the ciphertext was wrong) can help attackers in guessing attacks or confirming when they have found the correct key.

#### 7. **Consider Ephemeral Keys**:
   - **Issue**: Reusing the same passphrase for multiple encryptions can increase the risk of certain cryptographic attacks.
   - **Recommendation**: Use **ephemeral keys** (derived from a new passphrase or a new salt each time) to encrypt each message. Alternatively, implement session-based encryption keys for systems that require multiple operations.
   
   **Why?**: Ephemeral keys ensure that even if one encryption is compromised, it doesn’t affect others.

#### 8. **Validate the AuthTag**:
   - **Issue**: AES-GCM’s security depends on verifying the integrity of the data using the AuthTag. If this step is skipped or improperly handled, data can be tampered with undetected.
   - **Recommendation**: Always ensure that the AuthTag is properly validated during decryption.
   
   **Why?**: AuthTag ensures that any modification to the ciphertext is detected, making it essential for protecting against tampering.

#### 9. **Avoid Storing Passphrases in `localStorage` for Long Periods**:
   - **Issue**: Storing sensitive data like a passphrase in `localStorage` can be risky, as it persists across sessions and can be accessed by malicious scripts or browser extensions.
   - **Recommendation**: Use **sessionStorage** instead of `localStorage` if the passphrase must be stored temporarily, or clear the passphrase as soon as it is no longer needed. Alternatively, prompt the user for the passphrase every time.
   
   **Why?**: `localStorage` is persistent and accessible by JavaScript, making it a target for XSS attacks.

### Summary of Recommendations:
- **Switch to Argon2 or scrypt** for stronger password protection.
- **Increase PBKDF2 iterations** if sticking with PBKDF2.
- **Enforce strong passphrases** to protect against brute-force attacks.
- **Use a secure random number generator** for generating salt and IV.
- **Ensure a 12-byte IV** for AES-GCM encryption.
- **Use generic error messages** to avoid leaking information.
- **Consider ephemeral keys** to enhance encryption security.
- **Validate AuthTags** to detect tampering.
- **Use session-based storage** for passphrases instead of `localStorage`.

By following these recommendations, you can significantly improve the security of your encryption and decryption process.
